# CODING-ONE 

<h2> PROJECT DESCRIPTION </h2>

This project was inspired by The Adams Family and in particular the cello scene from the new Netflix adaption made by Tim Burton with Jenna Ortega, Catherine Zeta-Jones and The OG Christina Ricci. It's uncanny spooky camp. 

<h3> THE CODE </h3>

I build the whole thing with THREE JS by building a world made up by a Sphere Geometry and a Plane Geometry. I tried first to go with the Skybox textures that allows for a more infinite feeling, but I couldn't find any free SkyBox Texture packages online. It worked out in my favour as I have the final vibe feels more claustophobic as if you're too close to the objects. 


<h3> MAXIMILIAN </h3>

If you have ever silenced a horror movie you would know that half the horror lies in the soundtrack. Therefore, I found it vital to incorporate sound to the project. I imported cello chords as my main sound and on top of that violins and real sounds. It was a struggle to get it to work in the beginning as Maximilian has updated it's syntax since week 2 where we were introduced to it.
